This is my first project. Written in Pascal language, this program is your partner when it comes to helping you study.
It's code is very simple because Pascal was the first language that I learned. The code is also quite simple and primitive.
The program supports 3 languages and the main functions are:
.calculator
.Periodic table
.Physical constants
.Formulas
.Appointments
.Clock
.Game
